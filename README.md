I have been thinking about a free and open-source service, you can use to communicate with others in audio (and video?) channels, as well as via chat (not a console-chat, you only see, when you are online) for a long time. But also after long research I didn't find, what I was looking for. So I decided to create this myself.

I'm not shure if this will ever be a working software but I thought, it would be a nice first step, to create a GitHub-Repo.
